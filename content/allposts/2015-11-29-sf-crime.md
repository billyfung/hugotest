# Looking at crimes in SF

So the next Kaggle competition I've started looking at is the SF crime
prediction one. The first steps that I've begun taking is exploring the data
to figure out certain relationships. For now I'll post this graph of the top 3
crimes shown on a map of San Francisco. I spent some time trying to get an
interactive map working where you can clickon the type of crime and then it
would display it on the map, but I haven't completely figured out how to get
it working smoothly yet. Ran into some issues loading everything into an
interactive plot, the training data is 878049 observations, which might be a
bit large for something interactive?
