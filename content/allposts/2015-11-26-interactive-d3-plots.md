# D3.js interactive posts

A picture is worth a thousand words right? So a moving picture must be worth
even more! Since I've been playing around with R and data science-y stuff I
figured it would be worth it to play around with interactive graphs. They seem
to be all the rage these days, with many media sites using them and I also
think they're pretty great to show off lots of data at once. It'd be like
showing an embedded pivot table (I bet this exists). My website is made with
[Middleman][1], so this is a markdown blog post with d3.js.

Here's an iframe (not very nice):

```
<iframe src="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4061502/0a200ddf998aa75dfdb1ff32e16b680a15e5cb01/" 
width="600" height="400" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

And here is an animated graph done using d3.js:

All in all, it's pretty neat to make these things and I will probably use more
them to show off different things in the future. To do: figure out centering
figures on my posts.
