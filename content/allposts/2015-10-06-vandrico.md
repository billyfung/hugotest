# Vandrico application

So I’ve been applying to jobs and I’ve found that I get pretty interested in
jobs that have coding challenges. Mainly because it gives me something to
focus on for a little bit, instead of just droning away trying to make my
cover letter interesting. One recent coding question involved making a POST
request and then guessing a number.

It seemed like a harmless enough question and since I don’t come from a
software background, it seemed fun to me. To tackle the problem, I used the
requests module in python, and then implemented a binary search to reduce the
amount of time to guess the number. Binary search is a divide and conquer
algorithm, so you are recursively adjusting the range in which you are
searching for the number.

```python
    def binarysearch(num, low, high):
       numguesses = num 
       theguess = (low + high)/2
       guess = {“guess”:theguess}
       r = requests.post(url, json = guess)
       r.text
       if high < low:
          return -1 #lol high isn’t less than low
       else:
          mid = (low + high)/2
       if “correct” in r.text:
          return (mid, numguesses)
       else:
          if “high” in r.text:
             numguesses = numguesses + 1
             return binarysearch(numguesses, low, mid-1)
          else:
             numguesses = numguesses + 1
             return binarysearch(numguesses,mid+1, high)
```

I never heard back so this means either my solution isn't complete or they
just don't like my solution. I suppose it would be beneficial to write unit
tests for it?
